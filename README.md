# Statement downloader

_Tool to securely automate regular downloads of various utility and bank statements_

## üì≤ Install

First install [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), then clone and install the app:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jancimajek/statements-downloader.git
$ cd statements-downloader
$ npm install
```

## üõ† Configure

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
DEBUG="statements-downloader:*,secret-env,download-watcher"
VAULT_DATA_DIR="/path/to/your/vault/data"
VAULT_SECRET_PATH="secret/path/within/vault/to/the/secret/json"
VAULT_TOKEN_FILE="/tmp/.vault-token.json"
UNWRAP_TOKEN_FILE="/tmp/.unwrap-token.json"
DOWNLOAD_DIR="/path/to/your/chrome/download/folder/"
TARGET_DIR="/path/to/your/target/folder/"
```

Export `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable (best place this into the `~/.bashrc` file):

```bash
$ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
```

## üîê Vault

### Start Vault
```bash
$ npm run vault
...
Vault server started. Unseal by running 'npm run vault:unseal', 'vault operator unseal' or in browser: http://127.0.0.1:8200
```

### Unseal Vault
- UI: http://localhost:8200/ui/vault/unseal
- CLI:
  ```bash
  $ npm run vault:unseal
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  $ vault operator unseal
  ```
- Confirm vault is unsealed:
  ```bash
  $ vault status | grep Sealed
  Sealed          false
  ```

### Secret JSON format
The downloader expects the secret JSON to be in the following format:

```json
{
  "statement_provider": {
    "username": "user",
    "password": "P455w0Rd",
    "downloadRegex": "^statement_regex_.*\\.pdf$",
    "targetDir": "path/to/target/folder/relative/to/TARGET_DIR/"
  },
  ...
}
```

The `downloadRegex` should match the statement file format for given `statement_provider`. The `targetDir` should be path to directory where the statements for this provider should be moved after download, relative to the `TARGET_DIR` environmental variable.

### Troubleshooting Vault:
- Make sure `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable is set:
  ```bash
  $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
  ```

- Check Vault status:
  ```bash
  $ vault status
  Key                Value
  ---                -----
  Seal Type          shamir
  Sealed             true
  Total Shares       5
  Threshold          3
  Unseal Progress    0/3
  Unseal Nonce       n/a
  Version            0.10.4
  HA Enabled         false
  ```

- Vault logs into `vault.log`
    
## üì• Download statements

```bash
$ npm start
```

You will be prompted to enter the broker token.

### Filter statements to download
Use environmental variable `MOCHA_GREP` to filter which statements should be downloaded. The value should be a `RegExp` pattern matching `describe` or `it` label. 

```bash
$ MOCHA_GREP=Sky npm start
// or
$ MOCHA_GREP="(Sky|Tonik)" npm start
```

See [Mocha grep documentation](https://mochajs.org/#-g---grep-pattern) for more details.

### Troubleshooting

#### Problem:
The script crashes with the following error:
```bash
   connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4444

   socket hang up
       at createHangUpError (_http_client.js:331:15)
       at Socket.socketCloseListener (_http_client.js:363:23)
```

#### Solution:
This is a weird error when selenium sometimes doesn't start properly. Simply re-running the script should fix the problem (it may need to be re-run a few times until it works).

#### Problem:
The browser hangs loading a page.

#### Solution:
Sometimes you can manually reload the page in the test Chrome but usually nightwatch will have crashed by then. In that case, you'll need to re-run the script.

## üîí Stop Vault
Once done downloading the statements, stop Vault:

```bash
$ npm run vault:stop
```
